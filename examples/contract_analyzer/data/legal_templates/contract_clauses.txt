# Legal Contract Reference Guide

## Common Contract Clauses

### 1. Indemnification Clause
An indemnification clause requires one party to compensate the other for certain damages or losses. 

**Key Considerations:**
- Scope of indemnification (what events trigger it)
- Cap on liability
- Whether indemnification is mutual or one-sided
- Carve-outs and exceptions

**Red Flag:** One-sided indemnification that places all risk on one party.

---

### 2. Limitation of Liability
Limits the amount of damages a party can recover.

**Important Aspects:**
- Types of damages excluded (consequential, punitive, incidental)
- Cap amount (often tied to contract value or fees paid)
- Carve-outs for gross negligence or willful misconduct
- Super cap exceptions for IP infringement or data breaches

**Red Flag:** One-sided limitations or unlimited liability for one party only.

---

### 3. Termination Provisions
Defines how and when the contract can be ended.

**Consider:**
- Termination for cause vs. convenience
- Notice requirements (30 days, 60 days, 90 days)
- Cure periods for breach (time to fix issues)
- Effect of termination (survival clauses, wind-down)
- Termination fees or penalties

**Red Flag:** Termination at will with no notice period, or excessive termination fees.

---

### 4. Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure (NDA)
Protects sensitive information shared between parties.

**Key Elements:**
- Definition of confidential information

- Exceptions (publicly known, independently developed)

**Red Flag:** Perpetual confidentiality obligations or overly broad definitions.

### 5. Intellectual Property Rights
Addresses ownership and licensing of IP.

**Important Provisions:**
- Work product ownership (work for hire vs. license)
- Pre-existing IP remains with original owner
- License grants (exclusive, non-exclusive, perpetual)
- Assignment rights and restrictions
- IP indemnification

**Red Flag:** Vague ownership terms or unintended IP transfers.

---

### 6. Warranties and Representations
Statements of fact or commitments about the subject matter.

**Types:**
- Express warranties (specifically stated)
- Implied warranties (merchantability, fitness for purpose)
- Disclaimers (AS-IS, limitation of warranties)
- Warranty period and remedies

**Red Flag:** Excessive disclaimers or very short warranty periods.

---

### 7. Force Majeure
Addresses unforeseeable circumstances preventing contract fulfillment.

**Typical Events:**
- Natural disasters
- War, terrorism, civil unrest
- Government actions
- Pandemics (increasingly included)
- Labor strikes

**Consider:** Notice requirements, duration limits, termination rights.

---

### 8. Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation
Restricts competitive activities.

**Key Limitations:**
- Duration (1-2 years typical, depending on jurisdiction)
- Geographic scope
- Definition of competitive activities
- Employee non-solicitation

**Red Flag:** Overly broad restrictions that may be unenforceable.
